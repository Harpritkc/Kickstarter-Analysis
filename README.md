Purpose
A deep dive into Excel, as we know, Excel is a tool that can be used across all Organizations areas, including from household budgeting to complex financial analysis. Learning from the intricacies of Excel will draw on (and enhance) skills we may have already, like computer literacy, data literacy, and quantitative reasoning. Including advanced Excel features formulas, charts, and pivot tables.

-Import data into a table for analysis.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some time dataset is irrelevent to the present time of the requirements so have to make adjustments depending on the circumsantces or present situations

We can create the sum of pledge by country, outcome, subcatergery of parent categery, particular musicals, play or theraters and many other tables or graphs depending on any chategery we can pick
